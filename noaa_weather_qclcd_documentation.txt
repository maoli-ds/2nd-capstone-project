QUALITY CONTROLLED LOCAL CLIMATOLOGICAL DATA 

Effective January, 2005, flags will be available for most data elements:

If data are suspect: 
s will appended to the value on the web form 
s will be placed in a column following the suspect value in the ASCII form 
If data are flagged as erroneous, it will not be printed. 

**NOTICE OF CHANGE: 
Effective July 28, 2000, observations contained in the Quality Controlled LocalClimatological Data Hourly Observations table are reported in whole degreesFahrenheit. The dry bulb, dew point and wet bulb temperatures were originallyreported to the nearest tenth of a degree Fahrenheit. The Automated Surface 
Observing System (ASOS) records temperatures and dew points in whole degreesFahrenheit and converts these values to the nearest tenth of a degree Celsius forobservation transmission. Until this date, these values online have incorrectlybeen converted back to the nearest tenth of a degree Fahrenheit, implying a levelof precision that is not present at the instrument level. We apologize for anyinconvenience this may cause. 

The Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) generally records temperatures anddew points in whole degrees Fahrenheit and converts these values to the nearestwhole degree Celsius for observation transmission. Also, AWOS stations will oftenhave less data (i.e., fewer weather elements) than ASOS stations. 

NCDC forms contain: 
whole degree Celsius temperature values for AWOS stationstenths degrees Celsius temperature values for ASOS stations
